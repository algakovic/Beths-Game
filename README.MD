# Beth's Game

## This is a personal Project made for my Partner coded entirely in python with pygame library. 

To get started, initiate Beth's_Game_V2.py with python.

- Hover your mouse over the bird in the center of the picture.
- Listen for this bird's sound.
- In the next screen try to find that same bird which is hiding now in the new picture. Uncover it by hovering your mouse over where you think it is.

 ## Aspects of the code:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Pygame library
- Pygame mixer
- Event Management 
- global scope functions.
- Game looping, with single main while loop.
